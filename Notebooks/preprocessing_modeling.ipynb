      " there is still lots of work to be done on self-esteem issues. but overall: it is worth a tshirt from now on. thank you :) i'll be honest. i have been living with my mental illness for so long. you just said you were the exact same age that you are now. but yeah: to me: it sounds more like my parents and siblings are all just not that far along for me and in my opinion: they really don't understand me. that's how i have always felt: like i shouldn't even try to explain myself in words. but they also didn't take into account the possibility that a lot of times my dad and older brother would just give that as an excuse to act all crazy and irrational on me.i'm 21. just been diagnosed with bipolar ii because my father was not interested. (a couple years ago) but i'm very proud of my brother and sister for being just likeable and not having it too easy. but as i'm sure you guys know: i have to get therapy. it feels more like a struggle than if i hadn't been born with it though as i've always been raised like that. there are times i was really sad and depressed. my siblings and i would just go to bed at night and cry for about 3 days straight without even sleeping a single day: but my parents would literally watch me cry out to them before the next day would even be up (my dad in particular) and think that i was getting better just because i did those things in the past: but you can't say that. i mean this is how i feel with the anxiety that i was told i was going to get during my school years. just being told it was 'normal' and 'healthy' and not feeling any change would be like watching someone in the future suffer through childhood and the changes. as far as my parents being supportive: i think we're lucky that my mental illness is hereditary because it sounds like the way my family is right now is a lot harder than before since they think we're weak too and need to be controlled. but for me: it's very difficult to let go of the fact that i don't want to let go of my mother because i don't want my sister to grow up like i did. my mom was kind to and supportive of this child (my sister is pretty sure her mom is in her own mental illness so that's the other thing that made me feel like i couldn't let myself leave her: and that was probably the second time she tried as well) so i'm always trying to tell her stuff but just don: and now we're only having a conversation: but i'm the one saying stuff to her while she doesn't want to talk to me and isn't really listening. i've even had her telling me i'm 'just a bad person' and all these random things. it's just been harder to hear myself speaking to my mother than it was to hearing voices too for a while. and it really started affecting my sense of self where i was scared to do things and not knowing what was going on inside of me so i kept it to myself and didn't let her tell me. so i'm just not getting out. now? i haven't even had a therapist for like a year. i still can't go to a therapist because i feel like i'm just a bad person. it'll be almost a year before i get one though. i'll try not to be too hard on myself for this but i really need to get one myself. but in terms of the other stuff i'm having to endure: honestly i'm just kind of numb. i don't even have a therapist either because i feel like i can't even talk about it with my mom and my sister at this point in time. it feels all i can bring up is them saying 'it's the right time to talk about it' and my mother saying 'hey it might be a good time to talk' but not really wanting to admit that she is struggling with this stuff too. so i kind of keep it to myself for the time being.i'm 24 and when my mom died i was in college and all of her kids took the same name as my father's and that really made me feel empty that she hadn't taken that into consideration when i was growing up that was the only life i had. so now i have this new life to grow up that's so hard for me. i can't talk to my siblings without them telling me to go 'oh come on we're so jealous' and then after my siblings tell me that i go 'oh so that'd be nice' and then the thing is when my mom died i just felt very sad. we grew up close and so did she and even still we felt nothing and i just started feeling sad even though i used to be able to talk about my struggles. well to tell the truth she died too the same way. all the pain she endured during that time. she died in a\n",

      " be in a better place emotionally now. that's enough to take a person away from a suicidal situation and i would assume it is enough for people with bpd. bpd is also treated by a psychologist and by some meds (like ssris [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]). it makes my depression more difficult but does help my bpd.yeah i wish i had some more information regarding this. some of this information may be misleading: it’s not my intention to make you feel bad but my suggestion could be too drastic. some people on this forum think that mental illness is more of a social issue. it’s not: it’s a physical issue. you’re also seeing symptoms in different people at the same time: but not all of them. a lot of times the symptoms are similar to one another and not entirely identical: but still different enough so you can see a difference. the problem with all of this is that people who have bpd usually end up treating one another instead of treating themselves with the same treatment: which causes social dysfunction.i don't think it’s so much the same as to say there’s no cause and effect. if this is you: the answer is to not be a wimpy person: but not being overly dramatic. i have bpd myself so my problem isn't really a social one: although i think if we had a lot of people from different cultures living in my area (as in the u.s. for example) to have the same problem i am sure there’s one or two people who would pick up one of those symptoms in someone and assume it’s some social problem. that way you can help yourself rather than others in that problem. i'm sure you don't have to take any action: you just can’t be too dramatic about it. when someone feels hopeless and wants to kill themselves it doesn't mean you don't want to help: it just means it is you: your problems are real: and people will do what you want to do when you feel hopeless: as they have to to survive: and sometimes help helps them in their own way or in a different way so you can be free from your sadness: your pain and your problems.<|endoftext|>\"\n",

[RESPONSE]what i’m trying to say is when it’s time to make a changei agree. and i understand the feeling of knowing a lot is wrong... i think we should try to find out as well. when i went to the doctor: there were no delusions or hallucinations. i knew that my diagnosis was not a good one. when i got diagnosed: the thing is: i knew it wasn't one. i had been diagnosed with a few: i just wasn't ready to put it off anymore. i have a history of schizophrenia with a number of things: including paranoia: hypochondria: and a lot of other mental health issues. it took them about 7 years to get me a full diagnose. if this one turns out to be something i need to talk about when i'm sober: then so much the better: i wish i had a clearer answer on that. i'll take your advice.yes it’s a good idea: if you have a good psychiatrist. i used to be diagnosed myself: i was fine when i had one for a few years until i went off of a mood swing. for a long time i thought i was depressed. i had to go back to see the doctor. when i went: their diagnosis was good to the point: no delusions and i was diagnosed with schizophrenia. i was diagnosed back in 2015 but it was more of a diagnosis of psychotic symptoms. they wanted a good idea of what i should be worried about. for now: i'll stay at home and take my mind off it. good luck!<|endoftext|>\"\n",
      "\"<|startoftext|>[WP]should i just start therapy: but only when my psychiatrist's schedule is right? [RESPONSE]what about starting a new job? how far along will your social life be? what kind of job are you starting? is there anything that you can't do or that you don't want to learn? what kind of country have you been in: where are you from: what do you know? if you have to be in a big city or big city and have a job to work for: or are just just in that city: that's fine. if you already have something you are excited about: it's really important that you keep that thing. it might take time but it sounds like an interesting topic that you could get into and research. the good news is that when you start studying psychology you'll notice that you already study stuff like this: there's a lot to it that really does seem a lot less boring and maybe less scary. the bad news is that we don't have much information about how you study psychology: but\n",

      "] a little known sub-reddit - /r/selfcareadvice. we've had a couple people asking for support - you can find info and a link to their [subscriptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfcareadvice/wiki/subscribe) in the sidebar . thanks for your reply - i'll try to keep up to date of my posts here.i am so fucked up. i wish i could just die or kill myself. this is truly the worst feeling! i've been struggling with anxiety as well and the one i used to avoid was dealing with it so much. recently: however: i had to start dealing with anxiety because of a terrible experience i had (i think it was during high school: or earlier i think). i don't want any contact with anyone (personally: other than my family) if i can help it because of this and it really feels like the worst feeling to me. i've been wondering if maybe i am having a panic attack: and that i can get better by calling the doctor and just being honest: and i know he will help me. anyway: i know it sounds silly: but that is what i have been thinking about.thank you for the advice :) i have been having this same conversation with my parents: and when i say \"\"i'm sorry: but how can i get away from these thoughts so we can deal with them at least \"\" they just keep talking over me and my dad. in the meantime: i'm also trying to take care of my own health. i have been going to the doctor once a week for a few months: and that definitely helped a lot; i have had problems in the past: so being able to give my diagnosis to them and then be able to get the correct medication helps the most: thank you :)yeah: just thought i'd share that with you. i'm 23 and a self-taught neurosurgeon. the best i've ever felt in my life. thanks for the info.i don't like to talk about stuff like this: it can give me anxiety. if you get enough anxiety this will actually make you feel worse but try and get help<|endoftext|>\"\n",
      "\"<|startoftext|>[WP]people with bpd get anxiety. how is it different from social anxiety? [RESPONSE]i don't really understand the difference but social anxiety is more of an anxiety disorder with social anxiety/social withdrawal- if it's anxiety that's social anxiety. if it's social anxiety i guess it is both and it's just anxiety or social anxiety: it could be both at once.<|endoftext|>\"\n",
      "\"<|startoftext|>[WP]how do i let my brother leave the house? [RESPONSE]i've gotten out of my parents' house before at 11. for some reason it's considered a bad thing or if you're not allowed to be home by the time. my brother was 18 at the time and he always left the house when i was very young. he didn't want the responsibility but he knew i hated being backhome and he wanted to help make sure i didn't feel like we lived alone together. (thank you for this)he's 18 and is living with a girlfriend. the reason he left was so he could move into the apartment he'll share with his girlfriend. it just so happens my mom is also his grand-nephew. i'm a single mother: and when i was his age (19): i got an assignment for a college: so i came home to be with my cousin who went to see me a few weeks ago. her parents were still in the house. my cousins are both his family and we do not know if they are married or not. we do know my sister is pregnant as well. my parents were not home at the time because they were both at school or on some school trip etc. it just seemed like a really shitty time so i didn't know how they would react to that...my mom wanted to get out of the house but we didn't have any more resources in our house yet. her grandparents live with a friend. my dad went to his house: but her grandmother had just moved into my family's property. my dad ended up at another family member's house to stay with them: and his grandfather slept with his grandmother. he never tried to contact my parents. he had just been in there for a few weeks but had decided to come home again. we have been living together for a while now: but he just couldn't. he wanted to go home with his grandmother: or his mother. the only other option is to come home together and he still wanted to stay at my grandparents' place. my dad just told him it was his home and he could go out there whenever he wanted. this is probably one of the worst moments in my life. i didn't want to leave my home: i don't even want to\n",

[RESPONSE]i know that: but i will try out this. thanks!this seems to me like a really good idea and i'm going to try it out.i guess if its something that needs to be done it should be good. i think you should make an appointment with a therapist and take it one step at a time. they should have a guide to help: but don't jump right in until they say you have to go. my biggest advice is just to wait until you feel comfortable with the therapist to make a plan. it might not feel like it and might feel weird: but it is definitely something that will help you. they may not look at it from the first session: but be mindful of where it is located in your life: and if its anywhere close at all. then it should be up to you to choose where its at: how you feel about it going to therapy: and how you'll handle any changes in your life going forward. i hope this helps you. take care of yourself.i think a lot of you think this: but the problem is not that your life is boring. when my mother died: i had no future job. when i was 20: i spent all my money on food at restaurants or other junk food that i needed to buy. when i was 23: i got a student loan and my life was basically okay. for me: that was the problem. i realized that money and not people are important when you think about it. however: it can be hard to accept that there is something you love that you didn't know before.<|endoftext|>\"\n",

      " cases when someone's mental health is so good: and when there's been a huge success story involving medication: then it's reasonable to think that's exactly what the problem has been. i guess this is just a hypothetical question: however: i think it's quite reasonable to think that the mental issues that caused the pandemic could be the cause of the problem. i think the best we can do is to focus on how we can get more people to help in the first place: that way we can have a positive impact on people's mental health.i can't speak for all those people. i hope that's the case for me as well though. i think that it's an awesome idea. my best memories of seeing a psychiatrist are a few weeks before a hospital admission: when i thought i was having a panic attack or a nightmare. it's been 2 years since you left the hospital and just a few months before your diagnosis. that's when you can look back with satisfaction. maybe you don't even consider to be okay with your symptoms. we take some risks and you still look like a kid and are in a good mood. if you've had a terrible experience: you know you can be sure that the treatment will work. so how's your mood today?i think that the problem is actually that people don't know how the system was designed. i used to think as a kid that there's not enough people that would actually try to help people. people won't look for it: or they won't care. but for me: i was wrong and: for example: when a friend of mine said that her sister was suicidal: i had already started to realize that my sister was not just mentally ill but in a depressive state. and i was so depressed that i'd go down my armchair saying \"\"i can't do that: she's not just depressed: maybe it's a good thing to kill myself\"\" and then it happened that i realized that it's never an irrational idea that's gonna happen. in my case: it was a matter of the only option i could see was murder: which i actually did. my best advice i can give is to remember this: you're not alone. i know that i know i have a lot to live for but i can definitely never be sure what happiness means and i cannot truly make it my own. because of that: i know that the best thing i can do is to make sure that something is going to help me: and when i do want to make it my own i won't do it by force and i will make it my own. you need to have a chance to live: it's only because you take a risk it's not your best: it'll take a lot more before you have more than you want but you have more life than you want. do this: you deserve happiness. be the friend that makes you feel better: if you don't like that someone give up. if you can't live your best life then don't feel sorry for yourself by giving up but give yourself a little better: a little more happiness.because the first step of therapy isn't really about understanding what your illness means? that's not what your therapist's actually talking about. first: let's acknowledge that we're talking about something with specific characteristics. like mental illness and not just general depression. you need to understand why they're not good or not and they aren't wrong or not right. as a consequence: if they try to do something you'll ask why they think it's wrong and they'll admit that they are wrong and will try to treat you better. if then you think that it might actually help to change your behavior and they don't like that: we have no right to do anything that might cause you to lose your job. so your best thing to do is to talk about how they did it: that's exactly what they're going to do to treat you mentally. talk to them about this. then they'll ask you why you're not okay with that. you've said it yourself that you'll only get so bad: but to be healthy: you have to learn how to cope and not make stupid mistakes too. and that means you need a therapist: who can help you manage your symptoms and improve your life. you've gone there and done it. don't just sit around and do nothing as you're not doing anything.i think i speak for the majority when i say that i was extremely lucky to find therapy. in fact: a therapist or someone in a psych ward isn't your normal psychiatrist: and so the fact that you were able to get therapy on any given week even when your mental illness was so bad: speaks volumes about your success. the second part of the problem that you have to deal with: and the reason you need therapy is to get out of the loop of the system: right. to be able to access an actual licensed professional therapist. if what you're asking is actually: \"\"what's wrong with you and why do you want to\n",

      " is really: really easy to get distracted from all of that by whatever you're seeing in a movie or a cartoon or whatever and it's just not true. if you find yourself at the edge of having a panic attack: i would not recommend going on that vacation with someone you trust. you’ll be safe there and if they know you’ll be okay: they’ll be there to support you. if you need someone to talk to: i can’t say how to talk to them: but i guess you should reach out to someone. or you could say that you need help: but in a completely different way. i think that you should maybe talk to someone instead of going somewhere vacation because the vacation's probably not what you want to do when you get back. or you could just give up and move on. just have someone support you when you go back home. i hope whatever you think about is not just a vacation episode for your sake. if you need support and guidance: please let me know: i’ll be happy to listen. hope you stay safe and happy.hi: i just want to get the perspective of what your situation actually is at. i’ve had this experience for many months now that i have no clear reasons to complain about. it’s not a bad situation: i just don’t understand why your brain shuts down to that point. i know it’s something that your family may be worried about: but if you can explain how you are dealing with the issues that you’re experiencing: then that would be a great starting point to figure out how things have impacted you. if you’re still worried about it: i would recommend talking to your family about this: even if it’s something small and maybe something that they will not be able to help you with: which is understandable: since they may not have the time for it. there may even be ways to get them to be aware of your feelings so that they can give you support in case you start to get upset that they can’t support you. the best way to have this conversation with a close family member will be to do what i do for myself: and tell them that you’re not feeling well: that you want to see something that you want to feel: but you are afraid of what your doctor may suggest. then in turn: talk about how you’re seeing something and how you need advice: and how you think it could help. you can talk to them or they can speak to you: but you need time to have that conversation and find your own way. your doctor can not help you if you just say that it’s not working and stop trying to get the answers. you need to learn to think of it from that perspective: and get the answers together from that perspective! the best way to describe a lot about yourself is as a baby. sometimes: you want to be a baby. sometimes you want to be just big and strong: and sometimes you want to be just your parents or whoever. if you are not happy: your brain will shut it off so that it can come to peace with the idea of the baby it is. but you will never understand it because it never knew you. when you are the grown up version of you: you will only know at a certain stage when you stop getting your answers from the place in you that you learned to learn them from. you will never know the true way to make you feel about a topic until you figure it out. my guess is that you will be fine: especially if you figure out that something is wrong with your brain. you will be fine the way you are: because you are a baby. it will take months to figure this out: but that's how it will be. you just have to wait until the brain stops making it work. then you will be okay. just know that the baby: from age 1: has always been scared of the real thing and not being able to handle being around other big things. it's almost like you're afraid of being eaten by a dragon or something and you're worried about not seeing the dragons that way. the only way to have this conversation that makes sense to you is to get the answers from the place in you that you learned as a baby and learn the answers from those two answers. if you find the answers and then do the same for the dragons and eat them: you will have at least a start. so you've got to figure this out now. it took me a long time to figure this out: but i am 100% sure to figure this out. the only thing stopping you from going home would be your family feeling like you should: and even though that might be a lot more than you deserve: don't let it stop you. you might get upset if you're forced to go home as well: but as someone who is a mom to you that is not my job to tell you\n",

      "ede to one of their therapists: and she told us that she's working with a therapist. you can also try to see your gp: and if they don't help you: you can take this post to your doctors to get some help. i hope you have a better day.yes: they are still the same. we are just trying to find therapy. and she is still trying to give meds: so i'm hoping that she can help me get back on medication when it comes back. thanks for the comment that should help us. she sounds very angry but it's ok to not want to listen to her. i'm not going to say everything will be good but i will try: just the worst thing is that she can still be really mean and rude. thanks for the comment.she is very angry. not angry: more depressed than usual.i told her i have suicidal thoughts and she asked me what was wrong and i pointed out i need help but she told me to keep being nice and try to be a friend. this makes too much sense and makes me feel like she is trying to do something with me. she said i need to tell her how important i am to me so i shouldn't let her get upset with me for something that isn't even my fault. i also feel like i was overreacting and that i am trying to get her to understand and care about me when it's clear she is having a serious problem. but i can only help her and i need help now.thank you for putting in the effort. i’ll keep trying so she knows i’m trying: as much as i feel this hurts me and that i can’t understand: i really do understand that she is trying to help but i just can’t seem to see how she can be more supportive of me while still feeling this way.i know you may have said this all the time: but it’s so important to talk to a professional with a professional to work with. the last time i talked to a therapist about this was in the last semester of high school when i told them i needed help and then i got locked up. as soon as i told them what i had in terms of thoughts i had i immediately broke out crying. it helped to talk to someone but also to help the therapist so that you feel better. i know how hard it can be to talk to someone. i was told i need medication so i felt it was better for me to talk to someone who knows what they are doing to help me rather than giving me drugs they know i can’t afford. my last therapist told me: \"\"this isn’t for you: it’s for your mom. you are not your drug. i understand you need help but don’t listen to her to convince you you should see a therapist. you need to find someone who can help you. people need help too and they don’t know what to do with that.\"\" i don’t think that is exactly what you deserve. your need for help is so important and if her reaction is something like that please contact her directly. if she is mad: but not angry: tell her right away not letting her make you feel as you are feeling and that you need help.she sounds very angry and hurt: i feel like her anger is due to depression that has gone untreated and untreated depression: so she must now seek a mental health professional as she was never diagnosed. there's still lots of things she may still be able to do though such as medication and be in regular contact with a therapist<|endoftext|>\"\n",
      "<|startoftext|>[WP]how does a person know they are not having suicidal ideation? [RESPONSE]i’m sorry you have to struggle with this. i’ve been on the verge or at least close to a similar situation: at least not yet. a lot of what it feels like is a kind of emotional numbness where your sense of what someone can see is diminished as you don’t really see anything. it’s like you’re watching the person you’re with but not really seeing their actions or thoughts. i can also only assume that there’s an underlying issue that causes some of this but it still takes me by surprise.it’s so fucking confusing because as i understand it: i have ptsd and it’s like i can’t get out but i think i can only function because of having ptsd. but i’m like why does it matter if i feel ptsd? i’m not even living with my father. how does it matter if i know the difference between depression and suicidal ideation? the thoughts and the symptoms just aren’t making me feel anything<|endoftext|>\n",

      " are the biggest things that have helped. my mental illnesses helped me a lot in a way that was very: very uncomfortable and painful. it took a lot of time to learn how to cope and manage: and even more time to make the changes i was promised. i have tried to give people some compassion and empathy for their problems. i know that is hard: but it is absolutely possible: just not in a positive form for me. there are people who have made it out through the rough waters: or had their shit together and got promoted to management level: or are in a position where they can manage without a degree. if you can afford it: give it a shot: even if you can't fully afford a degree. it really helped me tremendously: to the point where it made getting out of bed all that much easier (even though i was in debt). so i would say it does get tough: but i hope that it does get better. if you ever want to talk: i'm here: or you can just message me. i'm here for you.yeah sure: if it can be achieved: i guess it should.that sounds really bleak and sad: and i feel ya on the pain thing: but the people have worked through pain and they're still here. if it is really not worth the pain its worth it too.yeah i feel like this too. i dont even know where to begin because i dont see my therapist anymore. but i want to be happy: i want to live for now but its not worth living for: for what?what made you think of the trauma? like what made you think you deserve it? what makes you think you dont deserve it? what makes you want to be alive and what does it make you want to do about it? what makes you want to try to be better? it seems like just about anyone with some semblance of self identity and a genuine belief in that identity would self-deprecate from personal experience even more so.i think you are right - this is a hard issue: it is definitely valid and i admire your struggles.<|endoftext|>\"\n",
      "\"<|startoftext|>[WP]how do i approach my therapist about a possible diagnosis/prognosis? [RESPONSE]it is your right to ask your therapist about it and/or their diagnosis if it is not related to your symptoms/behaviour. i was diagnosed with ptsd when i was 20: after a long period of \"\"just living\"\" i was diagnosed with schizoid personality disorder and bpd.<|endoftext|>\"\n",
      "<|startoftext|>[WP]can't talk about my mental health to therapists because of what happened [RESPONSE]i feel like you should have a list of mental health problems so they know what they're dealing with and how to help you out with that.it’s called \"\"the confidentiality rule\"\": basically they’re supposed to protect your confidentiality. i think you need to be able to say: \"\"i am suffering from a mental health problem and i have confided in this therapist: this therapist is really concerned about whether they need to see me: what they need to do: what their rules are and when they need to let me talk or what they are supposed to do.\"\" so your therapist can know what to expect and what isn't being discussed because there shouldn’t be anything left to discuss.<|endoftext|>\n",
      "\"<|startoftext|>[WP]could anyone say their diagnosis on a post? [RESPONSE]the dsm-5 is the bible: it's the first diagnostic manual you will ever get. i would say the diagnostic criteria for each mental illness is something like 5 symptoms and: as stated by dr. dave carbonell of the univ of kansas: \"\"i think it is best to have your diagnosis at time of appointment to have the best grasp on the illness.\"\" the dsm-5 (as well as most medical manuals) recommends you not say \"\"psychiatric diagnosis\"\" on a post: because that is considered a slur and offensive to people who don't agree with you. i would strongly advise against it.you can: and i think you ought to. i think you should give the post your own time. take each person's time and reflect on it.<|endoftext|>\"\n",
      "<|startoftext|>[WP]why do people like me?? [RESPONSE]sounds kinda cliche but a lot of people like me cause i say stuff that makes them feel good and sometimes i feel like i'm an easy person to be around i feel that because i can't seem to get people to care for me i say stuff that makes them feel positive like \"\"i'm so glad you're here\"\" so it's probably a way to feel like you're better then everyone who didn't care and i feel you can be happy too. you can have positive feelings and people\n",

      " [RESPONSE]it is absolutely normal to feel depressed and it is not bad to feel that way. there is nothing wrong with your parents to feel that way and it would be better for you if you talked with your parents about it. they might be able to help you out in some way: or at least not judge you and you don't have to feel like they do. if they don't feel like they can help you out: it's worth looking into. i hope this helps.\n",

      " [RESPONSE]well: don’t do anything dumb. but if you’re not happy: that’s a problem. if you’re not happy: that’s a problem. if you want to be happy: that’s when you should be happy.i was just thinking that you could start by not trying to control your feelings or thinking that they are a problem. you can start by taking a step back and saying \"\"i don't want to bother you.\"\" if you feel this way: you might want to try the habit of letting go of your negative thoughts and feelings. then: you can focus on getting back on track. good luck!\n",
