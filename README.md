# Capstone-3-GPT2-Mental-Health-Advice
Mental and physical health are equally important components of overall health. Mental health plays a huge role in general well-being and can affect physical health. Poor mental health can lead to poor physical health or harmful behaviors. An AI-based chatbot can be used as one of the primary care tools to improve general well-being. It can also benefit people who are hesitant to seek professional help due to anxiety caused by stigma and prejudice around mental illness.
## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to build a model that would take a question from a user as input and that would show an ability to give a sensible, relevant to the topic and human-like answer, as well as show strong grammar and spelling.
